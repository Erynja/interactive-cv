# Space Panda Interactive Resume

Welcome to the **Space Panda Interactive Resume** project! This interactive web experience showcases the skills, hobbies, and contact information of Space Panda in a fun and engaging way. Navigate through sections by controlling Space Panda and interact with elements to reveal more details.

## Features

### Interactive Navigation
Use the keyboard to control Space Panda and scroll through sections.
- **Key controls:**
  - `A` for moving left
  - `D` for moving right

### Hobbies Section
View a selection of hobbies with interactive visuals like a film strip, book, SNES console, and rocket. A chart grows dynamically to show interest levels when Space Panda reaches the section.

### Skills Section
Click on stars to uncover hidden skills. Rocks reveal themselves as part of the moon's surface after transitions are complete.

### Dynamic Backgrounds
Gradients and transitions enhance the visual experience.

### Contact Section
Icons for GitHub, email, phone, and a CV download link are displayed. Text descriptions appear above icons, and animations enhance hover interactions.

## How It Works
### JavaScript Highlights
#### Scroll Triggered Animations
Elements such as charts and rocks are triggered based on Space Panda's scroll position.

```javascript

const chartTriggerPoint = 2100;
if (scrollContainer.scrollLeft >= chartTriggerPoint) {
    growCharts();
}
```
Keyboard Navigation
Space Panda's movement updates the scroll position dynamically:

```javascript

window.addEventListener("keydown", (e) => {
    if (e.key === "a") moveLeft();
    if (e.key === "d") moveRight();
});
```
Interactive Stars
Clicking on stars reveals corresponding skills:

```javascript
Code kopieren
document.querySelectorAll(".star").forEach(star => {
    star.addEventListener("click", () => showSkill(star));
});
```
